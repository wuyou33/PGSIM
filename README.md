# PowerNet: Multi-agent Deep ReinforcementLearning for Scalable Powergrid Control
An on-policy, cooperative MARL algorithm for voltage control problem in the isolated Microgrid system by incorporating  a  differentiable,  learning-based communication  protocol,  a  spatial  discount factor, and an action smoothing scheme. 

## Installation
- create an python virtual environment: `conda create -n powernet python=3.6`
- active the virtul environment: `conda activate powernet`
- install pytorch (torch>=1.2.0): `pip install torch===1.7.0 torchvision===0.8.1 torchaudio===0.7.0 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html`
- install the requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## PGSIM
A python implementation of IEEE-34 bus and a 20-DGs Microgrid system with Numba [5] which is an open source JIT compiler that translates a subset of Python and NumPy code into fast machine code.  The simulation platform we developed is based on the line and load specifications detailed in [3].

## Usage
To run the code, just run it via `python main.py`.  The config files contain the parameters for MARL policies.
